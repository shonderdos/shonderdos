### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hi, my name is Serge Honderdos!

I'm a javascript developer with UX/UI skills based in Haarlem, The Netherlands.

Since 2011 I have been working as a software developer. Not afraid of hard work and always keen on accepting new challenges. Based on my experience, I prefer an Angular and NodeJS environment, but I'm familiar with the entire javascript stack.
